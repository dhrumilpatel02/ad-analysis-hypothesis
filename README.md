# Hypothesis Statement

- If Samsung increases their Weekly Advertisements then their Weekly Sales are expected to increase.
- The mean sales of ad1 is 30,000 units per week which is our null hypothesis.

# Step-by-step outline disproving hypothesis statement

To advocate our Hypothesis statement, we will need to run the t-test:
•	After loading the necessary library (openintro), we view the dataset “adanalysis1” for initial assessment.
•	For further assessment, we plot the “adanalysis1” dataset in a histogram and layout summary of statistics.
•	The t-test provides all the details including t value, data frame size, p value, alternative/null hypothesis, range of 95% confidence interval, sample estimates (mean).
•	When we run the t-test, if the obtained p-value matches the significance level then we will accept the null hypothesis, if not then we will reject it.

# Summary of findings and conclusion

•	As mentioned in the t test output, p-value (9.651e-05) is way less than the significance level (0.05), we reject the Null Hypothesis (Ho: µ =30000) and accept Alternative Hypothesis (Ha: µ ≠ 30000)
•	As a result, we reject the hypothesis statement: If Samsung increases their Weekly Advertisements then their Weekly Sales are expected to increase.
